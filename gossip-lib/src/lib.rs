//! Gossip lib is the core of the gossip nostr client.  The canonical binary crate is
//! `gossip_bin`.
//!
//! This library has been separated so that people can attach different non-canonical
//! user interfaces on top of this core.
//!
//! Because of the history of this API, it may be a bit clunky. But we will work to
//! improve that. Please submit PRs if you want to help. This interface will change
//! fairly rapidly for a while and then settle down.
//!
//! # Using gossip-lib
//!
//! To use gossip-lib, depend on it in your Cargo.toml
//!
//! ```rust.ignore
//! gossip-lib = { git = "https://github.com/mikedilger/gossip" }
//! ```
//!
//! You may specify optional features including:
//!
//! * Choose between `rustls-tls` and `native-tls`
//! * `lang-cjk` to include Chinese, Japanese, and Korean fonts (which grow the size significantly)
//!
//! # Gossip Startup
//!
//! Gossip starts up in three phases.
//!
//! The first phase happens at static initialization.
//! The globally available GLOBALS variable is initialized when first accessed, lazily.
//! You don't have to do anything special to make this happen, and you can start using
//! `GLOBALS` whenever you wish.
//!
//! The second phase is where you have to initialize a few things such as `Storage::init()`.
//! There may be others.
//!
//! The third phase is creating and starting the `Overlord`. This needs to be spawned on
//! a rust async executor such as `tokio`. See [Overlord::new](crate::Overlord::new) for the
//! details of how to start it. The overlord will start anything else that needs starting,
//! and will manage connections to relays.
//!
//! # User Interfaces
//!
//! The canonical gossip user interface is egui-based, and is thus immediate mode. It runs on
//! the main thread and is not asynchronous. Every call it makes must return immediately so that
//! it can paint the next frame (which may happen rapidly when videos are playing or scrolling
//! is animating) and not stall the user experience. For this reason, the `Overlord` can be sent
//! messages through a global message queue `GLOBALS.to_overlord`.
//!
//! But if your UI is asynchronous, you're probably better off calling `Overlord` functions
//! so that you can know when they complete.  Generally they don't return anything of interest,
//! but will return an `Error` if that happens.  The result instead appears as a side-effect
//! either in GLOBALS data or in the database.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Besides talking to the `Overlord`, the most common thing a front-end needs to do is interact
//! with the storage engine. In some cases, the `Overlord` has more complex code for doing this,
//! but in many cases, you can interact with `GLOBALS.storage` directly.

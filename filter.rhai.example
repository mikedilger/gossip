// This is a sample spam filtering script for the gossip nostr
// client. The language is called Rhai, details are at:
// https://rhai.rs/book/
//
// For gossip to find your spam filtering script, put it in your
// gossip profile directory. See
//    https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html
// to find the base directory. A subdirectory "gossip" is your
// gossip data directory which for most people is their profile
// directory too. (Note: if you use a GOSSIP_PROFILE, you'll need
// to put it one directory deeper into that profile directory).
//
// This filter is used to filter out and refuse to process incoming
// events as they flow in from relays, and also to filter which
// events get displayed in certain circumstances. It is only run on
// feed-displayable event kinds, and only events by authors you are
// not following. In case of error, nothing is filtered.
//
// You must define a function called 'filter' which returns one of
// these constant values:
//
//   DENY (the event is filtered out)
//   ALLOW (the event is allowed through)
//   MUTE (the event is filtered out, and the author is
//         automatically muted)
//
// Your script will be provided the following global variables:
//   caller        - a string that is one of "Process", "Thread",
//                   "Inbox" or "Global" indicating which part of
//                   the code is running your script
//   content       - the event content as a string
//   id            - the event ID, as a hex string
//   kind          - the event kind as an integer
//   muted         - if the author is in your mute list
//   name          - if we have it, the name of the author (or your
//                   petname), else an empty string
//   nip05valid    - whether nip05 is valid for the author, as a
//                   boolean
//   pow           - the Proof of Work on the event
//   pubkey        - the event author public key, as a hex string
//   seconds_known - the number of seconds that the author of the
//                   event has been known to gossip
//   spamsafe      - true only if the event came in from a relay
//                   marked as SpamSafe during Process (even if the
//                   global setting for SpamSafe is off)

fn filter() {

    // Show spam on global

    //  this script)

    {
        return DENY;

    // Reject events from new pubkeys, unless they have a high PoW
    // or we somehow already have a nip05valid for them
    //
    // If this turns out to be a legit person, we will start
    // hearing their events 2 seconds from now, so we will only
    // miss their very first event.
    if seconds_known <= 2 && pow < 25 && !nip05valid {

    {
        return MUTE;
    }

    // Reject events from muted people
    //
    // Gossip already does this internally, and since we are not
    // Process this is rather redundant. But this works as an
    // example.
    if muted {
        return DENY;
    }

    // Accept if the PoW is large enough
    if pow >= 25 {

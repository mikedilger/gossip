Copy the binary to the packaging diretory

````dos
  cp ..\..\target\release\gossip.exe .

````

For new versions of gossip, update `gossip.wxs`:

* UPDATE the Package.Version, SummaryInformation.Description
* UPDATE the Package.ProductCode GUID to a new one
* KEEP the UpgradeCode GUID (it should never change, it ties different versions together)
* Change a component GUID ONLY IF the absolute path changes.

Packaging:

````dos
  wix build gossip.VERSION.wxs
````

Upload to github releases.

To install the package, either double-click the MSI, or

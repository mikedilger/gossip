0. DON'T update dependencies. DON'T 'cargo update'.  Do that kind of stuff right after
   releasing. Because that stuff presents risk.

1. Update the documentation including:

   README.md
   help page in the UI

2. Stabilize the code. Make all these happy:

   $ cargo clippy
   $ cargo fmt
   $ cargo test

3. Edit Cargo.toml and change the version (remove the -unstable).
   Compile so you get a new Cargo.lock

   Commit these 2 new Cargo files as a commit named after the version.

4. Tag this as vVERSION, and push the tag

4b. Tag again with -unstable,
    build to get Cargo.lock,
    commit both as next commit,
    push,
    checkout the release commit again for the rest.

5. Build the debian:

   $ cd debian
   $ ./deb.sh

6. Build the appimage

   $ cd appimage
   $ cargo appimage --features="lang-cjk,video-ffmpeg"

7. Build the windows

   $ cd windows
   Follow the windows/README.txt

8. Build the macos

   $ cd macos
   $ ./build_macos.sh
   $ ./build_macos_intel.sh

9. Bundle the files, create SHA256 hashes

10. Upload release to github

11. Update the AUR packages

12. Announce release on nostr under gossip account


-----------------


This is a draft of the steps taken to make a release.
I intend to flesh this out as I actually make releases.

Update crates from the bottom up:
